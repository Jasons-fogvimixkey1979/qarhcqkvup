Just walked out and jeeez, my head’s still kinda spinning, like when you try to remember a dream and bits keep slipping away like fish in a barrel of Vaseline. You know how that goes. First things first, the theater was a CIRCUS. Kid behind me spilled his popcorn — some of which is now living in my hoodie. Back aching as if I'd been hauling haybales. Anyway, about Another Simple Favor...

Flashy lights and action like a kaleidoscope on a merry-go-round. Couldn't keep up with who was double-crossing who, kinda like trying to untangle earphones after they've been in your pocket too long. Can’t forget that scene — where they’re on the roof, and it felt like they were both as close as cats on a hot tin roof about to skedaddle.

> And then the car chase! It was as if they were racing through my mind — took those turns sharper than a fox escaping a henhouse raid. I swear my Coke nearly went airborne when they crashed into the... what was it? A fruit stand? Apples everywhere, but more like bowling balls the way they smashed windshields.

The sound was louder than a tractor plowing right into your eardrums, barely caught the dialogue sometimes… okay maybe I missed a couple lines but who needs 'em when the colors and pacing are like trying to read a comic book flipping through the pages too fast. Plot twists twisting like a tornado on a farm — part of me wondered if I was the only one who pieced it together right or if I somehow ended up in the wrong  . Speaking of 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 again, didn’t someone ask where to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ?

And those outfits! At some point, I had a random thought about the lead's jacket — fancier than a 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬 strutting about, my old overalls would be scoffed at. But there was this aura, like spotting a glittering UFO in the night sky. Makes you forget your seat is about as comfy as a bale of straw. The 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥... yeah right, easier to just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again for the bits that flew over my scatterbrain.

Anyway, it's getting late and seniors get cranky about sitting too long. Better get heading back to the barn before it feels like there’s an actual haywire in my head. Curly frys.

function stealScene (plotHole, popcorn) { return plotHole  0; } // Ahh, heck, how'd that get here?
